📚 DSA Repository – A Journey Through Logic, Bugs, and Occasional Panic

Welcome to the official home of Shady’s DSA programs — a place where structured learning meets unstructured internal screaming, but in a professional way.

😄 Why Does This Repo Exist?

To maintain a clean, organized, and committed space for all my Data Structures and Algorithms practice programs. Also because GitHub feels less judgmental than my compiler.

🧠 What You'll Find Here

A structured collection of DSA programs.

Code written with focus, discipline, and a dash of “Wait, why is this segmentation fault happening?"

Clean logic (mostly), optimized solutions (sometimes), and consistent improvement (always the goal).

🛠️ Languages Used

Primarily C++ . The goal is clarity, consistency, and avoiding the universal student problem of mixing all syntaxes at once.

📈 Why You Should Explore This Repo

✔️ If You’re Learning DSA:

You might find simple, readable examples of common problems.

✔️ If You Appreciate Humor:

The code is logical. My commit messages might not be.

✔️ If You Enjoy Growth:

This repo is actively updated as my skills evolve.

🚀 Roadmap

Add more categorized problems.

Improve code structure.

Achieve complete understanding of recursion (the dream continues).

🙏 Final Notes

This repository represents consistency, discipline, and the journey of becoming better each day. If you find this useful, feel free to star it — it helps with motivation more than caffeine.

🙏 Final Words

If you’re here to learn—good luck. If you’re here to judge—also good luck. And if you’re here by accident… well, welcome anyway.

**Star this repo if you want me to feel something again.**🔥
